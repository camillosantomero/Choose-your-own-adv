  <h1>Choose your own adventure!</h1>
  <h3>You took the minecart!</h3>
  <p>It has been a hard day of adventuring, after all, and you deserve a bbit of a treat. The minecart gets going pretty fast, and you notice that you've passed into the upper part of what looks like a huge cavern. You don't stay in the upper part for long, though, as the tracks suddenly end. Crash and burn, baby. </p>
