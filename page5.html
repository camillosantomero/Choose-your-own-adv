  <h1>Choose your own adventure!</h1>
  <h3>You walked!</h3>
  <p>You decide not to trust the rickety-looking minecart and tracks, and walk down the tunnel. The tracks go off into the air as the floor drops into a huge cavern, but you deecide to stay away from them and instead walk down the tunnel that turns off to the left. It spirals down and down, and after what seems like ages you reach the bottom, a smallish room with doors to the right and left. To the right, what look like sharpened bones lean against the door, while the left door has a wicked steel sword. Which way do you go?</p>
   
   <a href = "./page6.html">Go left, take the sword.</a>
   <br>
<p>or...</p>
<br>
    <a href = "./page7.html">Go right, take the bones. </a>
